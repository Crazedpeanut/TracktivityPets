He is sick of being considered an old, slow and out of date snail. His family is vastly wealthy and Melvin has noticed many other pet kingdom inhabitants with cybernetic components, and has decided that he himself should invest in this technology. However, he cannot achieve complete cyberisation alone and has requested your help in obtaining the various components he needs. What's in it for you? Money and friendship!",

He once lost a bet with a hare about which of them would win a running race, even though the hare had been so arrogant as to sleep during the race! Sheldon came to a conclusion: as a turtle, he saw no way to remedy his natural evolution in order to obtain the speeds and flight he so desired. That is, until now! Recently Sheldon has been provided with the rotors and abilities of a helicopter. However, Sheldon\u2019s technological cyberisation is not yet complete, and he requests your help in obtaining the various other components he needs. ",

When he first joined the kingsguard he was gifted the powers of lighting and fire by Merlin the Magpie (yes... magpie), but this magic has taken a terrible toll on Sir Oinksalot's body. Under the advice of the king and other advisers, he has been told to seek out the components to make himself a cyborg in order to maintain control over his body.  But he cannot do this alone! King Rupert has issued a royal requisition for assistance, will you answer the call?",
