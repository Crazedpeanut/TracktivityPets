However, he cannot achieve complete cyberisation alone and has requested your help in obtaining the various components he needs. What's in it for you? Money and friendship!",

He once lost a bet with a hare about which of them would win a running race, even though the hare had been so arrogant as to sleep during the race! Sheldon came to a conclusion: as a turtle, he saw no way to remedy his natural evolution in order to obtain the speeds and flight he so desired. That is, until now! Recently Sheldon has been provided with the rotors and abilities of a helicopter. However, Sheldon\u2019s technological cyberisation is not yet complete, and he requests your help in obtaining the various other components he needs. ",
