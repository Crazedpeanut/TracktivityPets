Its names sake comes from the many Palm \r\n\r\ntrees that are everywhere along the beach. The Palm trees provide shade to all that go there, \r\n\r\nwhich also is something that attracts the sun safe families as most of the other beaches in the \r\n\r\narea don\u2019t have sufficient shade.",

In the winter they get covered in a thick layer of snow that takes the fancy of many of the town folk who come to the hills to take on the ski slopes. In the summertime the hills are covered in numerous wild flowers and small green meadows, a favourite too many of the city\u2019s children for fun picnics and games.",
